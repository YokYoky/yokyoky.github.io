with the help of two references, we able to found the flag.

First I tested it with two accounts. Each account has their own.

testtest
test@test
```
{
  "id": "685f8bec3354286c6fbcd65c",
  "iat": 1751092204,
  "exp": 1751095804
}
```

testtest1
test1@test
```
{
  "id": "685f8bfe3354286c6fbcd666",
  "iat": 1751092222,
  "exp": 1751095822
}
```

Endpoint
![](/assets/posts/Neovault/assets/endpoint.png)

diggin in the site there is one user that is already exist. based from the reference Mongo-db id prediction. We start predicting it with the first user mongo id which is neo_system

neo_system
```
{"_id":"685f8a0c3354286c6fbcd64d","username":"neo_system"}
```
[mongo-object-id-predictor](https://github.com/andresriancho/mongo-objectid-predict)
```sh
./mongo-objectid-predict 685f8a0c3354286c6fbcd64d
...
... it will give a list off ids, then use it to enumerate
```

Every user has their own creation and expiration time. this endpoint also get the email i think i forgot

once we get the list of possible mongo id from mongo-objectid-prediction. We automately test it with bash script on transactions end point. If the user exist it will succesfully completed the transaction.

![](/assets/posts/Neovault/assets/idfound.png)

```
{"_id":"685f910e3b465c0cc2d67e7f","username":"user_with_flag"}
```

since there is early version, we can test for v1 for vulnerabilities. `/api/v1/transactions/downlaod-transactions` works, here we can modify the `_id` of user_with_flag

Download the download transaction of the user_with_flag, inside of the pdf is the flag.
